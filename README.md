Recast.AI official SDK in Golang.
Package documentation: https://godoc.org/github.com/RecastAI/SDK-Golang/recast

## Synospis

This module is a Golang interface to the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) API. It allows you to make request to your bots

## Installation


```bash
go get -t github.com/RecastAI/SDK-golang/recast
```

## Usage

### Package

```go
import "github.com/RecastAI/SDK-Golang/recast"

func main() {
	client := recast.NewClient(YOUR_TOKEN, "en")

    response, err := client.TextRequest(YOUR_TEXT, nil)
    if err != nil {
            // Handle error
    }

    intent, err := response.Intent()
    if err != nil {
		// No intent found
    } else if intent.Name == YOUR_INTENT {
        // Do your code...
    }
}
```

## Specs

### Structs

This module contains 4 main structures, as follows:

* recast.Client is the client allowing you to make requests.
* recast.Response contains the response from [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai).
* recast.Entity represents an entity found by Recast.AI in your user's input.
* recast.Intent represents an intent of the response

Don't hesitate to dive into the code, it's commented ;)

### Client

The Recast.AI Client can be instanciated with a token and provides the two following methods:

* textRequest(text string, opts ReqOpts) *Performs a text request*
* fileRequest(file string, opts ReqOpts) *Performs a voice file request*

*Accepted options are "Token" to override the token of the client, and "Language", to specify the language of the input*

If no language is provided in the request, Recast.AI does the following:

* TextRequest: the language of the text is detected and is used for processing if your bot has expressions for it, else your bot's primary language is used for processing.
* VoiceRequest: your bot's primary language is used for processing as we do not provide language detection for speech.


```go
import "github.com/RecastAI/SDK-Golang/recast"

func main() {
    var client *recast.Client
    var response *recast.Response

    client = &recast.Client{}

    response, err := client.FileRequest(YOUR_VOICE_FILE, recast.ReqOpts{
		Token: YOUR_TOKEN,
		Language: "en",
	})
    if err != nil {
		// Handle error
    }
}
```

### Response
The Response struct contains the following attributes:
```go
type Response struct {
	Source    string
	Intents   []Intent
	Act       string
	Type      string
	Sentiment string
	Entities  map[string][]Entity
	Language  string
	Version   string
	Timestamp time.Time
	Status    int
}
```

The Recast.AI Response is generated after a call with the two previous methods and contains the following methods:

* Intent() *Intent returns the first matched intent, or an error if no intent where matched*
* IsAbbreviation() *IsAbbreviation returns whether or not the sentence is asking for an abbreviation*
* IsEntity() *IsEntity returns whether or not the sentence is asking for an entity*
* IsDescription() *IsDescription returns whether or not the sentence is asking for an description*
* IsHuman() *IsHuman returns whether or not the sentence is asking for an human*
* IsLocation() *IsLocation returns whether or not the sentence is asking for an location*
* IsNumber() *IsNumber returns whether or not the sentence is asking for an number*
* IsPositive() *IsPositive returns whether or not the sentiment is positive*
* IsVeryPositive() *IsVeryPositive returns whether or not the sentiment is very positive*
* IsNeutral() *IsNeutral returns whether or not the sentiment is neutral*
* IsNegative() *IsNegative returns whether or not the sentiment is negative*
* IsVeryNegative() *IsVeryNegative returns whether or not the sentiment is very negative*
* IsAssert() *IsAssert returns whether or not the sentence is an assertion*
* IsCommand() *IsCommand returns whether or not the sentence is a command*
* IsWhQuery() *IsWhQuery returns whether or not the sentence is a wh query*
* IsYnQuery() *IsYnQuery returns whether or not the sentence is a yes-no question*
* Get(name string) *Returns the first entity matching -name-*
* All(name string) *Returns all entities matching -name-*

```go
response, err := client.TextRequest("Give me a recipe with asparagus. And a recipe with tomatoes.")
if err != nil {
// Handle error
}

intent, err := response.Intent()
if err != nil {
// No intent matches input
}

if intent == "recipe" {
    var ingredients []recast.Entity

    // get all 'ingredients' entities
    ingredients = response.All("ingredients")
}
```

### Entity
The Response struct contains the following attributes:
```go
type Entity struct {
	Data       map[string]interface{}
	Name       string
	Confidence float64
}
```

The Recast.AI Entity is generated by the Recast.AI Sentence and provides the following method:

* Get(field string) *Returns an interface{} corresponding to a field of the entity*

Attributes can be accessed by the Get method which can be one of the following:

* hex
* value
* deg
* formated
* lng
* lat
* unit
* code
* person
* number
* gender
* next
* grain
* order

```go
response, _ := client.TextRequest("What's the weather in San Francisco?")
var location recast.Entity
location = response.Get("location")
if response.Intent() == "weather" && location != nil {
	fmt.Printf("You asked me for the weather in %s\n", location.Get("formated").(string))
}
```
***Recast.AI entity fields type are dependant on the entity itself so Get returns an interface{}, you must do a type assertion as follows:***
* Numbers: float64
* Strings: string

Refer to [Recast.Ai Entities Manual](https://man.recast.ai/#list-of-entities) for details about entities
